# Student-Grade-Calculator
Student Grade Calculator Project

Developed a Java-based Student Grade Calculator that helps students efficiently calculate their grades. Key features include:

User-friendly interface for easy input of personal details and marks.
Dynamic handling of multiple subjects.
Robust input validation and error handling.
Detailed output with total marks, average percentage, and grade.
This project demonstrates my skills in creating user-centric applications, implementing validation, and applying logical structures for data processing.
